# What is a negative stiffness metamaterial?

A negative stiffness metamaterial is a type of engineered material that exhibits a counterintuitive mechanical behavior: when subjected to an external force, it deforms in the opposite direction to what conventional materials do. This means that under compression, it expands, and under tension, it contracts.
When a structure or system equipped with a negative stiffness metamaterial is subjected to vibrational energy, the negative stiffness component acts to counteract and absorb some of this energy. This reduces the amplitude of the vibrations and dissipates the energy more effectively than a system with only positive stiffness elements. As a result, negative stiffness metamaterials can be used to design isolators, dampers, and other devices that protect structures or sensitive equipment from unwanted vibrations.

# Why is it useful in optics & atomic physics?
The laser system we use for atom trapping requires an angle to be stabilized to within microradians of some optimal value. As you might imagine, any external vibration can cause variations in that angle that are substantially larger than the minimum precision we require for locking. Given that the entire optical setup is small and lightweight, there is very little mass to dampen such vibrations, and rather than bolt it into a big steel plate, it would be more elegant and convenient to utilize a negative-stiffness system to vibrationally isolate the optics.
