# What is the Talbot effect?
The Talbot effect is a near-field diffraction phenomenon observed when coherent light passes through a periodic diffraction grating. This effect manifests as the self-imaging of the grating pattern at regular intervals along the direction of light propagation. These intervals, known as Talbot distances, depend on the wavelength of the light and the spatial period of the grating. The fundamental Talbot distance () is given by the formula (), where  is the grating period and  is the wavelength of the light. At multiples of the Talbot distance, exact replicas of the grating pattern appear, while at fractional Talbot distances, sub-images or phase-shifted versions of the original pattern can be observed. 

# How do we use it to measure wavelength?
A full analysis of the mechanism of the Talbot wavemeter is given here: [1907.11072] Compact and high-precision wavemeters using the Talbot effect and signal processing. 
In short: the Talbot effect wavemeter works by passing laser light through a diffraction grating, which causes the light to form a periodic self-image pattern at certain distances behind the grating. This distance depends on the wavelength of the light. By capturing this interference pattern on a tilted image sensor placed close to the grating, the periodicity of the pattern can be analyzed to precisely estimate the wavelength. Signal processing algorithms are then applied to the sampled interference pattern to extract the wavelength information with extremely high precision.
